# Object-Character-Recognition-OCR-

 ### Here, I am building a custom OCR pipeline that combines YOLOv3 for object detection and Tesseract for text recognition. 
 ### The process involves detecting text regions with YOLO, cropping them, preprocessing them for better clarity, 
 ### and then using Tesseract to extract text before saving it as a CSV file.
